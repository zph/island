# Island

`no one is an island`

But scripts should be.

Do we need the right version of Perl installed to use ack? No, it's self contained.
Do we need the right version of Golang installed to use those tools? No, self contained.

Shouldn't ruby have a simple way to generate standalone scripts? Island thinks so and will help.

Generates standalone ruby scripts from gems.
